# Block

A Block is a collection of cells. The block module provides operations on the collection.

## TODO
### Palette

- single-source-of-truth for palettes, see config.py in model/README
- Stencil broke recurrink commit because it counted colours

###Â Meander

- padding can be exposed to the interface, as meta in the conf?
- meander: concentric could work for circles, triangles and diamonds
- resurrect the original meander and apply N or E in conf 
- add meander.style as a YAML attribute


## Runbook
### Create a new palette with pen names

> as a plotter controller i want to see a  
> display of pen names in inkscape   
> so that i know which pen to load next  


Create a GPL file.
stabilo68.gpl example

```
cd Library/Application Support/org.inkscape.Inkscape/config/inkscape/palettes/

r   g   b      penam hex
---------------------------
128 255 179 #  13    80ffb3
```
From the GPLFILE generate a palette text file with permutations of fg:op:bg.

```
./recurrink init --inkpal GPLFILE

palettes/stabilo68.txt
```
The palette file is a tab-separated list
```
fill    opacity background
#d7e3f4 0.5     #483737
```
The hex in the GPL and ver will become a composite PRIMARY KEY in the pens table.

There is no method to create an entry in the inkpal table. 
To do it manually

```
INSERT INTO inkpal (ver, gplfile) VALUES (DEFAULT, 'sharpie');
```
Now import the values from the GPLFILE.

```
./recurrink commit --inkpal GPLFILE
```
Now palettes/GPLFILE is in sync with db.pens. 
Add the new pens to the palette table.

```
./recurrink commit -p12
11 new colours 
66 new entries
```
To see the pen names in Inkscape use explode.
Explode will pass them to the SVG.

### Restore GPL file 

> as somone setting up a new machine i want to restore GPL files from database
To restore GPL files from DB for pals 8..11 

```
python -m scripts.mkgplfile
```

### Empty background
> as a rink designer i want the plotter to ignore the background layer

In the YAML set Background: ~

### Palette conversion
> as a plotter i want convert a rinks to use a new pen palette

To prepare create YAML 
`./recurrink clone -dRINKID`  
Check clone made conf/MODEL.yaml.

Export the old palette 
`./recurrink clone -d RINKID -o pal`
This will create a TXT file for palswap. 

Build a rink with `./recurrink build -m MODEL` to create `tmp/MODEL.svg`  
We will use this for comparison later.

Then run 
`python -mscripts.palswap build -d RINKID -p VER`  
This will find-nearest colour and build.  
`tmp/MODEL_PALSWAP.svg`  

It may need some BADLENs to be fixed.
Strokes may need to be added manually to palettes/DIGEST.txt

Finally the new and old rinks can be compared visually.  
Other palettes can be tried. Some palettes with fewer pens may collapse. Once ready.  
`python -m scripts.palswap commit -dRINKID -pVER `   
This will swap PIDs in the database and set VER to be the new palette for RINKID.
Clone again and check db has updated to new version.

ISSUES
```
buleria -
   koto -
  sonny white fg failed validation
  eflat strokes removed from db
  waltz white FG fixed!
  bossa relaxed op validation

palswap overwrites YAML cannot change manually
```

## Design
Future ideas that have yet to be done.

### Palette validation
> as a rink designer i want  
> to improve colour validation  
> with a simpler method of applying colour

relax validation so that at build time
fg:bg:op are checked individually, not as a trio
warn when opacity is a value other than (1, 0.5, 0)

checks are done against pens table
the colours table can be dropped
the method of generating a pallete with math.comb can be archived
the HTML palette pages show each colour exactly once (not trios)

cells table still refers to pid:sid
but they must honour existing pids. pid=fg:bg:op
at commit time, missing palette entries with valid values 
but a unique combination  should be silently added 
e.g. FF0000 0.1 00FF00  
ver can be dropped from palette table
this may cause PIDs with duplicate fg:op:bg combinationns?

### Database update the Cells and Geometry tables

> as a code maintainer i want a data model
> that represents how data is accessed

#### Geometry table

```
 gid    | integer 
 shape  | character varying(7)
 size   | sizes
 facing | direction
 top    | boolean
```
every geometry has two entries for top

#### Cells table

```
 view   | character(32)
 cell   | character(1)
 gid    | integer
 pid    | integer 
 sid    | integer
```
entries are unique by view and cell

#### Proposed change
Add a new column to the cells table for __layer__.
The layer values could be: 0, 1, 2 for bg, fg and top
Entries could be unique by view, cell and layer.
The top column for geometry could be removed.
The background field for palette can also be removed.
Validation of each entry could vary according to layer.
For example: background gid must be a medium square facing centre
